TOR - We recommend to download the full Vidalia Browser package. Remember that it is near impossible to stream media via TOR. TOR is designed to obfust=cate your Internet traffic so that your location can not be tracked by bad actors (like the government). You can obtain TOR at www.TorProject.org

Web Proxy Services - A web based proxy service will allow you to open up a tab in your browser to visit a web site from another IP address that is not your own. This is not designed to be a long term solution to anonymity, but rather a temporary solution for episodic needs.
