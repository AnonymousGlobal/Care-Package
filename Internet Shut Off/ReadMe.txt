We highly recommend that protesters, activists - and independent journalists go immediately to www.OpenGarden.com and download/install the OpenGarden software on all of your devices, both mobile and laptops. Opengarden is a meshnet. What that means is it utilizes the radios in your devices, both BlueTooth and WiFi - to connect all dvices in the area also running OpenGarden. In the event that mobile service is interrupted, devices using OpenGarden will still be able to communicate. Since all OpenGarden devices also share their throughput to the Internet, their connectivity with the World Wide Web - in the event of a service interruption if even one device in the meshnet can be somehow re-connected to the Internet (say, via a satellite phone or WiMax) the entire meshnet will be able to share in that connectivity. We also recommend utilizing OpenGarden now, even before any interruption - as it will allow those in the protest area to use mobile devices tha currently have no service plan, and give connectivity to laptop computers running OpenGarden. In the moderately likely even of a prolonged cell service interruption, Anonymous will attempt to re-connect the protesters by providing alternative connectivity to as many OpenGarden nodes as we can.

In the highly unlikely even of a broadband interruption, Anonymous will set up free dial-up phone lines with the help of our friends in TeleComix. We will Tweet this information (@OpFerguson) and also fax blast it to as many people in the affected area as possible for distribution to the protesters.
