We all love wearing the Guy Fawkes mask at protests. But if the shit hits the fan, take it off and switch to a dark colored bandanna. The police will actually aim sub-lethal and lethal ammunition directly at the masks, thus is their hatred for Anonymous. At least three Anons in the past few years have died as a result of being shot straight through their Guy Fawkes masks.

Carry a pair of rugged toenail clippers in your back pocket. You can use these to free yourself from plastic handcuffs, and liberate your fellow arrestees.

Recommended attire for street battle is: Bike helmet, gas mask, kevlar (bullet proof) vest, hockey shoulder & shin pads. Make a shield.

A bandanna soaked in vinegar ahead of time and placed inn a zip-lock bag is mildly effective against tear gas. Contrary to many manuals, including some in this package - we recommend STRAIGHT BOTTLED WATER for dealing with pepper spray exposure. However, chalking your eyes with sports chalk ahead of time is helpful.
